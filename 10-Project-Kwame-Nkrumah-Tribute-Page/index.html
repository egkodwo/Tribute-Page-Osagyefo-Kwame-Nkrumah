                <h3>Here's a time line of Dr. Nkrumah's life:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>1909</strong> - Born in Nkroful, Gold Coast (now Ghana)</li>
                    <li>Kwame was his mother's only child. She sent him to the elementary school run by a Catholic mission at Half Assini, where he proved an adept student.</li>
                    <li>He progressed through the ten-year elementary programme in eight years.</li>
                    <li>1925 - he was a student-teacher in the school and was baptized into the Catholic faith.</li>
                    <li>Here, Columbia-educated deputy headmaster Kwegyir Aggrey exposed him to the Pan-African ideas of Marcus Garvey and W. E. B. Du Bois.</li>
                    <li>1931 - After obtaining his teacher's certificate from the Prince of Wales' College at Achimota in 1930, Nkrumah was given a teaching post at the Roman Catholic primary school in Elmina in 1931.</li>
                    <li>When he arrived in New York in October 1935, he traveled to Pennsylvania, where he enrolled despite lacking the funds for the full semester.</li>
                    <li>He soon won a scholarship that provided for his tuition at Lincoln University.</li>
                    <li>He remained short of funds through his time in the US. To make ends meet, he did menial jobs on roles such as a wholesaler of fish and poultries, cleaner, dishwasher and others.</li>
                    <li>1939 - Nkrumah completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics and sociology in 1939.</li>
                    <li>Lincoln then appointed him an assistant lecturer in philosophy.</li>
                    <li>Nkrumah gained a Bachelor of Theology degree from Lincoln in 1942, the top student in the course. He earned from Penn the following year a Master of Arts degree in philosophy and a Master of Science in education.</li>
                    <li>Nkrumah was offered a job at the UGCC (United Gold Coast Convention)</li>
                    <li>Nkrumah hesitated but realized that the UGCC was controlled by conservative interests and noted that the new post could open huge political opportunities for him and accepted.</li>
                    <li>1947 - He began work at the party's headquarters in Saltpond on 29 December 1947 where he worked as a general secretary.</li>
                    <li>Nkrumah embarked on a tour to gain donations for the UGCC and establish new branches.</li>
                    <li>Beginning in April 1949, there was considerable pressure on Nkrumah from his supporters to leave the UGCC and form his own party.</li>
                    <li>On 12 June 1949, he announced the formation of the Convention People's Party</li>
                    <li>In the February 1951 legislative election, the first general election to be held under universal franchise in colonial Africa, the CPP was elected in a landslide.</li>
                    <li>Nkrumah was released from prison on 12 February, receiving a rapturous reception from his followers. The following day, Arden-Clarke sent for him and asked him to form a government.</li>
                    <li>Prior to the CPP taking office, British officials had prepared a ten-year plan for development</li>
                    <li>With demands for infrastructure improvements coming in from all over the colony, Nkrumah approved it in general, but halved the time to five years</li>
                    <li>Modern trunk roads were built along the coast and within the interior.</li>
                    <li>The rail system was modernized and expanded.</li>
                    <li>Modern water and sewer systems were installed in most towns, where housing schemes were begun.</li>
                    <li>Construction began on a new harbour at Tema, near Accra, and the existing port, at Takoradi, was expanded.</li>
                    <li>An urgent programme to build and expand schools, from primary to teacher and trade training, was begun</li>
                    <li>From 1951 to 1956, the number of pupils being educated at the colony's schools rose from 200,000 to 500,000.</li>
                    <li>On 3 August the assembly voted for independence under the name Nkrumah had proposed in April, Ghana. In September, the Colonial Office announced independence day would be 6 March 1957.</li>
                    <li>The opposition was not satisfied with the plan for independence, and demanded that power be devolved to the regions.</li>
                    <li>Nkrumah also sought to eliminate "tribalism", a source of loyalties held more deeply than those to the nation-state.</li>
                    <li>Primary education became compulsory in 1962.</li>
                    <li>In 1964, Nkrumah brought forth the Seven Year Development Plan for National Reconstruction and Development, which identified education as a key source of development and called for the expansion of secondary technical schools.</li>
                    <li>Laws passed in 1959 and 1960 designated special positions in parliament to be held by women</li>
                    <li>In 1957, Nkrumah created a well-funded Ghana News Agency to generate domestic news and disseminate it abroad.</li>
                    <li>Nkrumah attempted to rapidly industrialize Ghana's economy. He reasoned that if Ghana escaped the colonial trade system by reducing dependence on foreign capital, technology, and material goods, it could become truly independent</li>
                    <li>After the Ten Year Development Plan, Nkrumah brought forth the Second Development Plan in 1959. This plan called for the development of manufacturing: 600 factories producing 100 varieties of product</li>
                    <li>Nkrumah's advocacy of industrial development, with help of longtime friend and Minister of Finance, Komla Agbeli Gbedema, led to the Volta River Project</li>
                    <li>In February 1966, while Nkrumah was on a state visit to North Vietnam and China, his government was overthrown in a violent coup d'état led by the national military and police forces, with backing from the civil service.</li>
                    <li><strong>1972</strong> - Nkrumah died on 27 April 1972, in Bucharest, the capital of Romania</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="italize">"Nkrumah, in spite of his eccentricities, was largely defeated by his own success: the by-product of the considerable economic development achieved by Ghana was to stimulate and educate the masses and the new elite; their attitude to Nkrumah's regime became more and more critical in the light of the education the regime itself provided. When this happens, more and more repression and propaganda are needed to maintain political stability. In spite of considerable efforts, Nkrumah was unable to build a sufficiently ruthless police system. The cause of his downfall was not, therefore, the mismanagement of the economy—which was considerable — but rather the success of much of the development effort."</p>
